## üåê Custom API Implementation

### Purpose
Instead of using external APIs, a **custom PHP-based API** was created to fetch shuffled words and hints dynamically from the database.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Database Table: `words`**
   - Columns: `id`, `word`, `hint`, `difficulty`

2. **API Endpoint: `/api/words.php`**
   - Returns a random word and hint in JSON:
     ```json
     {
       "word": "planet",
       "hint": "A celestial body that orbits a star"
     }
     ```

3. **JavaScript Integration**
   - Uses `fetch()` to get a new word on game start
   - Randomly shuffles letters before showing it to the player
